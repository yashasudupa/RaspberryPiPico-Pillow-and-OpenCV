Problem 1 - gen_images.py:

Improvements as per feedback: 
i) Provided clear Instructions on how to run the script from the command prompt
ii) Formatted the code according to PEP 8b standards and added comments to indicate the critical lines of code
iii) Adjusted random rotation to prevent shape cut-offs for consistent image quality for the ML dataset.
iv) Implemented true random scaling for each shape.
v) Utilized available Python libraries for improved efficiency.

Problem 2 - main.py, UART_Host_to_uc.py, UART_uc_to_Host.py

Improvements as per feedback: 
i) USB Port and OS will be automatically detected by Host application.
ii) Rectified the angle input and motor rotation issue for accurate positioning according to input angles.
iii) Positive and Negative angles are properly read by the newly developed parser. Addressed inconsistent direction change problem, ensuring consistent direction changes for negative input angles.
