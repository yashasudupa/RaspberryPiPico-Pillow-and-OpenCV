Problem 1 - gen_images.py:

Improvements as per feedback: 
i) Added clear Instructions provided for how to run the script from the command prompt
ii) Formatted the code according to PEP 8b standards and added comments to indicate the functions of the critical lines of code
iii) Adjusted random rotation to prevent shape cut-offs for consistent image quality for the ML dataset.
iv) Implemented true random scaling for each shape.
v) Utilized available Python libraries for imporved efficiency.

Problem 2 - main.py, UART_Host_to_uc.py, UART_uc_to_Host.py

Improvements as per feedback: 
i) Port and OS will automatically detected by Host application and detects the port automaitcally.
ii) Rectified the angle input and motor rotation issue for accurate positioning according to input angles.
iii) Positive and Negative angles are properly read by the newly developed parser. Addressed inconsistent direction change problem, ensuring consistent direction changes for negative input angles.
